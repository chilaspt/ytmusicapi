Package tests
============================================
Tests use the ``unittest`` framework. Each function has a corresponding unittest.
Sometimes there is a single unittest for multiple functions to ensure there are no permanent changes in the user's YouTube account (i.e. subscribe and unsubscribe).

Note that there must be a ``headers_auth.json`` in the project root to run authenticated tests.
For testing the song upload, there also needs to be a file with the name specified in the code in the project root.

Copy ``tests/test.cfg.example`` to ``test.cfg`` in the project root to run tests with coverage.
Adjust the file to contain appropriate information for your YouTube account and local setup.
